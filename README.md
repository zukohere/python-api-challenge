This activity ensures weather statistics are gathers for 500+ unique cities, clean the data and ensure try/except conditions are used for error handling. The data is plotted to see if there is any relationship with Latitude (position north or south of the equator). The analysis is then split for northern/southern hemisphere and linear regression is used. The model is evaluated. 

The data is then handed as a csv file to another notebook that checks for hotels in locations with "ideal" weather conditions, and creates an interactive marker map with this information. 

All outputs are stored in the output_data folder. NOTE: cities.csv will be overwritten with each run of WeatherPy. Images will not, and are instead added by date/timestamp.
